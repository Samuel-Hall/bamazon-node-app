##Welcome to Bamazon Marketspace!

Bamazon Marketspace is a customer-facing command line application that uses Node.js and MySQL.

When the app is launched, it displays all items currently available for sale and includes their name, unique id, price, and current stock level. Using the node package Inquirer, the user is prompted to purchase one of the items listed. Once an item is purchased, the MySQL database is updated to reflect outgoing inventory, then the application starts over with the new data.
